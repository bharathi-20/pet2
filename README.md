Petto: Your Pet Adoption Platform | MERN Stack Project with Admin Panel

Petto is a website designed to help people either find a new home for their pets or adopt a pet themselves. If youâ€™re unable to continue caring for your pet, you can submit their details via a form. The admin reviews your submission and, if accepted, will ask you to bring the pet to a designated adoption center for listing.

If you wish to adopt a pet, you fill out an application with your personal information. Since the admin receives many requests, they select the most suitable adopter. Once chosen, your application is approved, all other applications for the same pet are removed, and the pet is taken off the adoption listings. The admin keeps track of all completed adoptions along with adopter contact details.

Petto aims to simplify the adoption process by connecting pets in need with loving owners.
